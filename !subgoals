subgoals

INITIAL FIREWORK
0.0 - Outline requirements for object
0.1 - Build an object that draws a dot on the screen
0.2 - Animate moving upward and stopping at a predetermined point

EXPLOSION
0.3 - Create object for particles from explosion
0.4 - fill an array with "particles" and draw on screen
0.5 - allow the firework object to take in array of particle objects
0.6 - shoot out array of particles on x axis
0.7 - stop the shot out particles at a certain point
0.8 - add particles that shoot out vertically
0.9 - made them explode into an even circle
0.10 - made the particles explode into an area confined by circle

FADING
0.11 - give particles gravity in fade function
0.12 - fade the particles by changing the alpha channel
0.13 - delete the initial firework point when it reaches the peak
0.14 - pick random particles to "glitter" by inverting the alpha channel until it fades

TRAIL
0.15 - set up trail object constructor and draw func
0.16 - make the initial particle a generator and draw a particle
0.17 - give particles random x y positions

CLEAN UP
0.18 - testing changing colours
0.19 - make array of colours
0.20 - make an array of fireworks to fire
0.21 - randomize height and correlate it to the size
0.22 - randomize the time that each firework fires



EXTRA (didnt get to do any of them)

Methods/properties for firework:
  - make the firework particles follow a set of general lines
  - make the fireworks glow with a grid
  - add smoke
